'we now know that there had not been an inspection of the cell for almost 60 days. they were able to dig a tunnel and it was easy to escape after that.' ezequias gonalves miranda and william pereira da mata were two of the crooks that tunnelled out of jail to freedom. it is unclear if they appeared in the video . more than freeman it was a daring breakout that echoed 1994 hollywood blockbuster the shawshank redemption, starring morgan freeman  and tim robbins   but with a very modern twist . the prison guard on duty has been suspended for not managing to foil the secret plot. a manhunt has been launched resulting in the capture of two men. the other 11 remain at large. it is not the first escape from brazilian jail. a year ago 54 prisoners staged a mass escape after a riot at the fundao casa youth detentionfacility in sao paulo, which houses more than 100 detainees. dozens of the underage offenders set fire to their mattresses, sparking a blaze in the prison's central yard. helicopter images showed plumes of smoke rising from the detention centre. video footage also showed prisoners climbing over the prison walls and escaping down trees. nearly 30 staff members were held hostage during the riot and the facility's director was admitted to hospital with cuts to his head and bruised ribs.\n",
