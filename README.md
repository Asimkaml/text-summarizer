# **Project Objective:** Create a system that summarizes lengthy articles, blogs, or news into concise summaries.

### **Task:** Text Summarization

● **Dataset**: CNN/Daily Mail Dataset  
● **Steps:**
1. Preprocess textual data for summarization.
2. Implement extractive summarization using libraries like spaCy.
3. Implement abstractive summarization using pre-trained models like BERT or
GPT with HuggingFace's transformers.
4. Fine-tune models to improve the quality of summaries.
5. Test the model on real-world articles and evaluate summary coherence.  
● **Outcome:** A summarization model capable of generating
concise summaries from long texts.
